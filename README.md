# weather-app
### Weather application

This project is very first a little bit more serious of all stuff I have ever created using React. Basically here is nothing special:
1) React; 
2) useState for state management;
3) Fetch function of JavaScript for fetching information (for this, special functions were created in loadInfo.js)
4) openWeatherAPI for information;
5) HTML
6) CSS ( CSS variables );
7) Vite (for file management and project management)
8) A lot of hard work and dedication (learning something new especially by yourself is not that easy);

Well, that is it for the project, you are free to download and use it, I have launched this project via Vite, but you are free to use React Create App, it doesn't matter.
Thank you for taking a look to this small beginner's project, God bless you.
